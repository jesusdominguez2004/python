- To be able to experiment with the code examples in this tutorial, you should have MySQL installed on your computer.
- You can download a MySQL database at https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.

- Python needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database.
- In this tutorial we will use the driver "MySQL Connector".
- We recommend that you use PIP to install "MySQL Connector".
- PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment.
- Navigate your command line to the location of PIP, and type the following:
- python -m pip install mysql-connector-python
